# CapsNet
Tensorflow implementation of capsule network (CapsNet) for traffic prediction.

Built with Python 3.5, TF-slim, numpy, pandas 

- Obtain spatio-temporal image representation of traffic speed data, which are time series data with spatial relationship
- Compare capsule network (CapsNet) and convolutional neural network (CNN) in a short-term traffic speed forecasting problem
- Evaluated with real data measured by induction loop detectors on the road segments of Santander city in 2016
